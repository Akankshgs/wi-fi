# Project Blueprint: WiFi Connection Simulator

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of a React-based WiFi connection simulator. The application will provide a user interface for connecting to a WiFi network, but it will not have actual control over the device's WiFi hardware due to browser security limitations.

## Current Features

*   **WiFi Connection UI:** A visually appealing interface for entering an SSID and password.
*   **Connection Simulation:** A simulated connection process that shows a loading state and then a success or error message.
*   **Modern Design:** A dark-themed, modern design with custom fonts and styling.
